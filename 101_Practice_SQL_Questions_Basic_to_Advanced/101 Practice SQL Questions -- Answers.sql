	Set EmailAddress = 'Ken.SÃ¡nchez@adventure-works.com'
	Where p.FirstName ='Ken'

The script above is not correct and would update both records. One of which is not the Ken SÃ¡nchez we are 
wanting to update. In this question we are going to set Ken's (the CEO) email back to the original email 
(assuming it has been updated from question 31). Then we are going to use BEGIN TRANSACTION, ROLLBACK, and 
COMMIT to fix/correct a mistake.  */

Update Person.EmailAddress
Set EmailAddress = 'ken0@adventure-works.com'
Where BusinessEntityID = 1


-- b. Check the number of open transactions by running: Select @@TranCount
SELECT @@TRANCOUNT

-- d. Run our incorrect update statement
Update Person.EmailAddress
Set EmailAddress = 'Ken.SÃ¡nchez@adventure-works.com'

UPDATE Person.EmailAddress
SET EmailAddress = 'Ken.SÃ¡nchez@adventure-works.com'
WHERE BusinessEntityID = 1;

COMMIT;


-- h. Question 33 we will automate whether the Transaction commits or rollsback.





-- QUESTION 33:

/* 
Complete questions 31 and 32 before attempting this question.

Before starting this question be sure the email address for both Ken SÃ¡nchez's are updated to their 
original emails. Run the statements below to be sure:

    Update Person.EmailAddress
	Set EmailAddress = 'ken0@adventure-works.com'
	Where BusinessEntityID = 1;
 
	Update Person.EmailAddress
	Set EmailAddress = 'ken3@adventure-works.com'
	Where BusinessEntityID = 1726;


In Question 32 we used BEGIN TRAN, ROLLBACK, and COMMIT to be sure that our updates work properly. 
Write a script that will commit if the update is correct. If the update is not correct then rollback. 
For example, If we know how many rows need to be updated then we can use a @@ROWCOUNT and if that number 
doesn't meet the condition then rollsback. If it does meet the condition then it commits.

Use the same update statement used in Question 32 (see below):

    Update Person.EmailAddress
	Set EmailAddress = 'Ken.SÃ¡nchez@adventure-works.com'
	Where BusinessEntityID = 1 
*/

BEGIN TRANSACTION;

In Question 46 we wrote two scripts that gave the same output/results. One script we used a

will help you learn when to use Case, Choose, and IIf. In question 46 we learned that the credit 
rating has a description (i.e. 1 = Superior). However, in this question we are going to assume 
that AdventureWorks only deems a vendor as "Approved" if they have a "Superior" credit rating. 
If the vendor has any other rating then they are "Not Approved". Credit Rating Grouping:

	1 = Approved
	2 = Not Approved
	3 = Not Approved

-- In question 49 we learned there are 6 user defined data types in the AdventureWorks database. In this 
-- question we are going to create a new user defined data type.

-- a. Using INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS write a query that will show every column that has the 
--		columnName = Status.  What is the data type for these columns?

SELECT data_type, *
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE (column_name = 'status')
	OR (column_name = 'Status')
-- Answer: smallint


-- b. Create a new User defined data type named 'Status." The data type will be tinyint and notice 
--		that in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS table the IS_NULLABLE column says 'No.' This means 
--		when you're creating the user defined data type be sure to specify Not Null.
CREATE TYPE status FROM tinyint NOT NULL


-- c. Write an Alter statement to change the data type on PurchaseOrderHeader.Status from tinyint
--		to the new User Defined data type, status. Did the Domain Name in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS change?

ALTER TABLE purchasing.purchaseorderheader
ALTER COLUMN [status] status


-- d. Try to Drop the Status User Defined Data Type. You will get an error. Why?
DROP TYPE status


-- e. Write an Alter Statement to change the data type on PurchaseOrderHeader.Status back to the tinyint
--		(don't forget the NOT NULL).

ALTER TABLE purchasing.purchaseorderheader
ALTER COLUMN [status] tinyint NOT NULL


-- f. Now Drop the Status User Defined Data Type

-- QUESTION 53

/*
This fictional scenario will be true for questions 51, 52, and 53.

As AdventureWorks continues to grow more and more data will be captured, meaning proper storage
and server space will be needed. Dan Wilson, the database administrator at AdventureWorks has 
reached out to you. Dan is currently working on a project to determine how much storage and server
space will be needed for the next year.

Now that we have calculated current state of the Adventureworks database in terms of storage and
space we need to calculate however much space will be needed for next year. Here are some 
assumptions we are going to use. First Adventureworks has been in operation for roughly 1127 days.
We also know that the next year will be 365 days. Which means we need to calculate the space 
(kilobytes) needed per day. Then we can use that daily average to determine what will be needed 
for the next year (1127 + 365 = 1492).

Here is the script provided in the 52 explanation:

	Create View vDatabaseAllocation
	AS
	(SELECT 
		t.name as TableName
		,Max(p.rows) as RowCNT
		,Sum(u.total_pages) * 8 as TotalAllocated_kb
		,Sum(u.used_pages) * 8 as Used_kb
		,(Sum(u.total_pages) * 8) - (Sum(u.used_pages) * 8) as Unused_kb
		,Case when cast((Sum(u.total_pages) * 8) - (Sum(u.used_pages) * 8) as decimal)
			/nullif(Sum(u.total_pages) * 8,0) < .10
			Then 1 Else 0 End as Flg
	FROM sys.allocation_units AS u
		Inner Join sys.partitions AS p ON u.container_id = p.hobt_id
		Inner Join sys.tables AS t ON p.object_id = t.object_id
	GROUP BY t.name)

Using the assumptions above calculate the projected space needed per table for current state and
the next 365 days. Again, 1127 + 365 = 1492. Either recreate the view or write an alter statement 
adding the new column.

/*
a. There are three main type of table triggers in the AdventureWorks database - Delete,
	Insert, and Update. Meaning a trigger will fire when a valid event (Delete, Insert, Update) occurs.
	Write a script that will show you every table trigger in the database. Include the Following Columns:

	- TriggerName (ObjectName)
	- SchemaName
	- TableName
	- TriggerType (Delete, Insert, Update) */

SELECT
	trigger_name,
	trigger_schema,
	event_object_table,

-- a. Find the insert trigger on Production.WorkOrder. What is the  name of this trigger?

SELECT
	trigger_name,
	trigger_schema,
	event_object_table,

FROM information_schema.triggers
-- Answer: Production.iWorkOrder

-- b. What is this trigger doing?
-- Answer: Inserting Values into Production.TransactionHistory


/* c. Run the insert statement below:

	INSERT INTO Production.WorkOrder

    Where CurrentFlag = False
	
You will notice that every employee in the database is considered a current employee.
We are going to create a Trigger that will update a departure date when the employee 
current flag is updated to "1". */


-- b. Write a statement that will add a column to the HumanResources.Employee table. 
--		Call the column "DepartureDate." Make it a date datatype.

ALTER TABLE HumanResources.Employee
ADD COLUMN DepartureDate date CONSTRAINT;

-- c. Create a Trigger called HumanResources.uEmployee on the HumanResources.Employee table.
-- 		Have the trigger set the DepartureDate = GetDate() when the current flag is updated to "0".
CREATE TRIGGER HumanResources.uEmployee

-- d. Now set the current flag = 0 for BusinessEntityID 2. And check the DepartureDate in HumanResources.Employee
UPDATE humanresources.employee
SET currentflag = True
WHERE businessentityid = 2

-- e. Write a statement that will drop the trigger if it exists.
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS humanresources.uEmployee


-- f. Add another step in the trigger that will set the DepartureDate to NULL if the current 
--		flag is updated back to "1"

UPDATE humanresources.employee
SET currentflag = 1
WHERE businessentityid = 2

-- g. Drop the trigger

DROP TRIGGER humanresources.uemployee


-- h. Delete the DepartureDate column

ALTER TABLE humanresources.employee
DROP COLUMN departuredate
